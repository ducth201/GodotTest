In "ChronoShift: Rogue Timeline," you play as a rogue time-traveler, exploring various timelines and altering historical events to your advantage. Your name is Dr. Eon, a brilliant scientist who discovered the secret to time-travel after years of research. However, your unorthodox methods and disregard for the ethics of time-travel have led to your exile from the scientific community.

Your journey begins in the year 2150, in a dystopian world ruled by a tyrannical regime. You steal a time-travel device from your former lab and set off on a quest to change the course of history and create a better future.

As you travel through time, you encounter various challenges and enemies. Powerful time-keepers seek to prevent you from altering the timelines, while rogue factions try to exploit the power of time-travel for their own gain. Along the way, you recruit allies from different timelines, each with their unique abilities and skills.

In each level, you must traverse a randomized timeline, fighting off enemies, collecting power-ups, and making critical decisions that impact the story. Your actions have permanent consequences, and the choices you make can lead to different outcomes.

One level takes you to the ancient city of Atlantis during its prime. Here, you must navigate treacherous underwater corridors, battle aquatic beasts, and uncover the city's long-lost secrets. Another level sends you to a post-apocalyptic wasteland, where you must scavenge for resources, fortify your base, and fend off hordes of mutated creatures.

Throughout the game, you collect powerful artifacts and upgrades that enhance your abilities and make you a formidable force in the timelines. However, each action you take and each artifact you collect carries a risk. The time-keepers grow stronger with each alteration, and the consequences of your actions may be more severe than you anticipated.

In the end, your actions will determine the fate of the timelines and the future of humanity. Will you restore balance to the timelines, or will you become the rogue timeline's greatest threat? The choice is yours in "ChronoShift: Rogue Timeline."
